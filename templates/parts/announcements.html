    <p>
        The CS109 midterm is coming up: it is next Tuesday (Oct 30th) from 7 to 9pm in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The midterm is open notes, open book, closed calculator. 

        <p>The best way to study is by working through the <a href="{{pathToRoot}}handouts/midterm.html">practice exams</a> and section problems. On Saturday at 12:30 pm we are going to hold a midterm review session in 420-040. Notes from the session will be published.

        <p>TAs will also be hosting extra office hours and conceptual office hours from now until the midterm. Check out the office hours page for times, locations, and the specific focus for each particular OH. Some OH will be focusing specifically on conceptual questions in preparation for the midterm, and all OH will prioritize homework problems "above the line" from problem set 4 over those "below the line".

        <p>OAE and alternate midterm assignments (request <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQtkQqDZp-2D1_OKEL2wveBr81QNPkP6_2syeGeGHXggsLrg/viewform" target="_blank">here</a> by Friday at 1 pm) will be finalized in the coming days; look out for an email with your specific logistics. Email Julia (jdaniel7) if you requested an alternate midterm and haven't received your information by Monday.

                There will be an optional Python tutorial Friday (Sept 28th) in Gates 104. Two of our wonderful TAs are hosting two separate sessions (both will cover the same material) one session is 10am - 11am the other is from 3pm - 4pm. Python is not required for CS109. However a few problems in the psets require coding and seeing as Python is the language of computer science for probability, its worth learning. We will post notes from the session.
